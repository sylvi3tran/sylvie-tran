# Hi, I'm Sylvie TRAN, a junior Angular/Java fullstack developper!<br/>Here's my bio :
👩‍🎓 Holder of a 2-year degree in IT and a bachelor's degree in databases, I had the opportunity to work for 3 years on a data migration. Between my studies and my first job, I was able to develop my creative and literary sides in University. After a recent gap year that allowed me to do some introspection, I am proud to say that I am back to the job market with my newly regained motivation!

👩‍💻 Since I was very young, I have had a certain appetite for technology. I confirmed it with my studies and internships. I am curious of everything : programming, databases, UI/UX, etc...<br/>
🎨 But also digital art, 3D, video games.... and crocheting, arts and crafts, modern languages ​​and music in my spare time! I also always have ideas for small tool apps to make everyday life easier.<br/>
🎯 One can say that I like to get hands-on and I love creating. Immerse myself in a project, around experienced coworkers whom can inspire me, that's all I need for my everyday work life!
This is why today I'd like to acquire and validate the skills of full-stack development (Angular/Java) by getting a job in block release training.

🙋‍♀️ My main strengths are my quick learning ability, and my analytical and critical mindset. I am also rigorous, organized, creative and attentive.
